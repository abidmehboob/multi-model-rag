Sample Document for Testing RAG Upload

This is a sample text document that can be uploaded to test the RAG system's document upload and processing functionality.

Artificial Intelligence Overview:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning Fundamentals:
Machine learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
- Uses labeled training data
- Learns mapping from input to output
- Examples: classification, regression

2. Unsupervised Learning:
- Uses unlabeled data
- Finds hidden patterns
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning:
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses reward/penalty feedback
- Examples: game playing, robotics

Deep Learning:
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Applications of AI:
- Healthcare: Medical diagnosis, drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles, traffic optimization
- Technology: Voice assistants, recommendation systems
- Manufacturing: Quality control, predictive maintenance

Future of AI:
The future of AI holds tremendous potential for transforming various industries and aspects of human life. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more sophisticated applications that can perform complex tasks with greater accuracy and efficiency.

This document serves as a test case for the RAG system's ability to process, chunk, and store text documents for retrieval-augmented generation tasks.
